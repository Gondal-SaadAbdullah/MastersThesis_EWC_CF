# Analysis of Catastrophic Forgetting in Deep Neural Networks
* We have analysed 4 types of algorithms to investigate Catastrophic Forgetting:
  * Elastic Weight Consolidation EWC (https://github.com/stokesj/EWC)
  * Fully-Connected NNs (with and without dropout)
  * Convolutional NNs (with and without dropout)
  * Local Winner Takes All  (with and without dropout)
